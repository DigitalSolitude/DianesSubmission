# Library System Project
When you run the code you will be greeted by numbered options on how to interact with the library system.
The first, 1) Add Book, asks you to enter the title, author and publication date in order for it to be added to the libraries inventory list.
The second, 2) Remove Book asks you to enter only the title of a book (non case sensitive), in order to remove it from your inventory.
Upon removing a book you'll be given a return date. I added this so that a librarian whose updating their inventory will be able to inform the borrower of the exact return date without checking their calendar.
The third, 3) View Inventory gives the user a list of all books currently in the library.
Finally, the fourth 4) Exit, closes the program.
